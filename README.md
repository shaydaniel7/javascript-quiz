## Javascript Quiz

```
- In this project, we were supposed to create a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. 
- The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updating HTML and CSS powered by a JavaScipt file. 
- The application is responsive to different screen sizes.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```
## Challenges
```
This was challenging for me as it required HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be created from scratch.
I was not able to complete a few aspects set forth in the acceptance criteria, namely a working timer.
